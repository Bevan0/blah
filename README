blah: bevan's lightweight aur helper

Stupid aur helper I wrote in an hour or two in Python. Provides apt-like commands for installing and removing.

Depends on:
- python
- python-click
- python-aur (AUR package/pip 'aur')
- setuptools
- git
- sudo

Don't use this unless you really like this - use an alternative like paru or yay

Install with 'python setup.py install'

Commands:
'blah install PACKAGE1 PACKAGE2 ETC' - installs the package or packages
'blah remove PACKAGE1 PACKAGE2 ETC'  - removes the package or packages
'blah search PACKAGE'                - searches for the package
'blah update PACKAGE1 PACKAGE2 ETC'  - updates the package
'blah update'                        - updates all packages installed
'blah list'                          - prints out a list of all installed packages

All AUR packages are built in ~/aur
