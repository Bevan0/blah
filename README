blah: bevan's lightweight aur helper

Stupid aur helper I wrote in an hour or two in Python. Provides apt-like commands for installing and removing.

Depends on:
- python
- python-click
- python-aur (AUR package/pip 'aur')
- setuptools
- git
- sudo

Don't use this unless you really like this - use an alternative like paru or yay
